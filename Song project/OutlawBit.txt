I'm for law and order, the way that it should be.
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me.
Someone called us outlaws in some ol' magazine
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen. 

Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand. 

We were wrapped up in our music, that's why we never saw,
The cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fill up with law.
They came pounding through the back door in the middle of the song.
They got me for possession of something that was gone, long gone. 

Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand. 

Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand, out of hand?
